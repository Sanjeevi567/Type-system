Must match return type 
contain block of expression (calll function,refer local & capture environment if the scope is not inside of function
 , * ,& ,ref ,ref mut ,  
let pattern = {} else{}
if let 
while let 
Only irrefutable pattern can be valid i.e pattern that can't be fail.
pattern destructing of 3 struct enum tuple array[x,y,z,..]:[i32;10]  in function parameter 
                    in let declaration
                    in for loop 
other pattern matching supports both refutable and irrefutable patterns like Result , Option
